# Tower Defense Game

This is a school project which was done using React + TypeScript + Vite. You can check the coursework definition document at `./CourseworkDefintion.pdf`

##

The purpose of the project was to get familiar with the three technologies previously mentioned, specially with React. The logic of the game depends entirely on states. Interactions trigger state updates to reflect those interactions on the screen. The game is all 'drawn' using a canvas component.

Please take into consideration the focus of the coursework was implementing the logic for the game, and not the graphics nor game-experience.
